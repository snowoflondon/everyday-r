# Introduction

*Note: this book is a work in progress. All source code for this project are available on my GitHub, which is linked in 1.4.*

This book serves as a collection of R Markdown files helps users in learning the practical syntax and usage of R for data science. Mainly, code snippets and workflow aimed at tackling everyday tasks in data science will be covered, which includes data cleaning, data wrangling, iterations, machine learning with `caret`, data visualization, and web app design using `Shiny`. Each broad topic will be split into chapters, though there will be some overlap.

## Preface

This book assumes readers have a basic grasp of R programming language. There are tons of useful resources that provides the first few steps into programming with R and I hope this book can serve as a useful complement to using R - a pocket reference of sorts! 

It depends on who you ask, but many users emphasize the importance of learning the syntax of base R before diving into commonly used packages like `dplyr` and `data.table`. It is definitely a good idea to get the hang of base R if you're developing an app or a package for example - this would lessen the number of dependencies your program has! 

However, similarly to `pandas` in Python, the popularity of `dplyr` and associated packages within the `tidyverse` suite has soared and you wouldn't be surprised to see `tidyverse` solutions as the top answers in forums like Stack Overflow (this can be frustrating if you're a base R purist). Using `tidyverse` for data science can definitely make your life easy - I find their syntax more pretty intuitive - but I'd like to sit on the fence on the base R vs. `tidyverse` debate; you should know both! For that reason, in this book I will try to use both interchangeably.

## R syntax in this book

Code chunks will be presented in a typical Markdown format as such, with the code output below:

```{r}
runif(n = 20, min = 0, max = 100)
```

When using commands outside of base R, the loading of the parent package will be explicitly shown to avoid confusion:

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(runif(n = 20, min = 0, max = 100))
```

Typically in longer chains of code, I will use `%>%` from `magrittr` as a pipe. This is usually standard practice in code using packages from the `tidyverse` so it's a good habit to start using it. However, keep in mind - as of the recent R version (shown below), there is a native R pipe `|>` which behave almost - but not always - in a similar fashion. 

Finally, here is the R version I am currently using:

```{r}
version
```

## R packages commonly used in this book

* `tidyverse`: a collection of packages for data science, including `dplyr`, `purrr`, `stringr`, `forcats`, `readr`, and `ggplot`.

* `caret`: package for implementation of machine learning models, with support for algorithms such as `ranger`, `rpart`, `xgbTree`, and `svmLinear`.

* `mlbench`: package for benchmarks and datasets in machine learning.

* `broom`: package for summarizing of model estimates.

* `ggpubr`: package for publication-ready data visualizations.

* `Shiny`: package for implementation and designing of interactive web apps.

## Installing R packages

R packages found in this book are available on CRAN and thus can be installed simply by running `install.packages()`. For packages not on CRAN (or if you want to download developmental versions of a package), you can install packages straight from a GitHub repository by running `devtools::install_github()`. 

## Code availability

All code used to compile this book as well as the individual markdown files are available on my repository [here](https://github.com/snowoflondon/everyday-r)

## Website hosting

This book is hosted on the `shinyapps` server, deployed with the R package `rsconnect`. The markdown files are compiled in this book format using the R package `bookdown`.
