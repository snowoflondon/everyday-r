# Introduction

*Note: this book is a work in progress. All source code for this project are available on my GitHub, which is linked in 1.4.*

This book serves as a collection of R Markdown files that aims to assist users in learning the practical syntax and usage of R. Mainly, code snippets and workflow aimed at tackling everyday tasks in data science will be covered, including data cleaning, data wrangling, iterations, machine learning with `caret`, data visualization, and web app design using `Shiny`. Each broad topic will be split into chapters, though there will be some overlap.

## R syntax in this book

Code chunks will be presented in a typical Markdown format as such, with the code output below:

```{r}
runif(n = 20, min = 0, max = 100)
```

When using commands outside of base R, the loading of the parent package will be explicitly shown to avoid confusion:

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(runif(n = 20, min = 0, max = 100))
```

Typically in longer chains of code, I will use `%>%` from `magrittr` as a pipe. This is usually standard practice in code using packages from the `tidyverse` so it's a good habit to start using it.

Finally, here is the R version I am currently using:

```{r}
version
```

## R packages commonly used in this book

* `tidyverse`: a collection of packages for data science, including `dplyr`, `purrr`, `stringr`, `forcats`, `readr`, and `ggplot`.

* `caret`: package for implementation of machine learning models, with support for algorithms such as `ranger`, `rpart`, `xgbTree`, and `svmLinear`.

* `mlbench`: package for benchmarks and datasets in machine learning.

* `broom`: package for summarizing of model estimates.

* `ggpubr`: package for publication-ready data visualizations.

* `Shiny`: package for implementation and designing of interactive web apps.

## Installing R packages

R packages found in this book are available on CRAN and thus can be installed simply by running `install.packages()`. For packages not on CRAN (or if you want to download developmental versions of a package), you can install packages straight from a GitHub repository by running `devtools::install_github()`. 

## Code availability

All code used to compile this book as well as the individual markdown files are available on my repository [here](https://github.com/snowoflondon/everyday-r)

## Website hosting

This book is hosted on the `shinyapps` server, deployed with the R package `rsconnect`. The markdown files are compiled in this book format using the R package `bookdown`.
