# Everyday-R
This repository contains a collection of Markdown files compiled with `bookdown` for the open-source book `Everyday-R` hosted [here](https://bookdown.org/brianjmpark/everydayR/). Each chapter aims to help learners of R programming language learn the practical syntax and usage of R in context of data science tasks such as data wrangling, data exploration, and machine learning.  

**This book is a work in progress and is not complete!**
